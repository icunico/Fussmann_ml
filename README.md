## What is fussmann_ml ?

The present model is based on the Fussmann food web (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdfdirect/10.1046/j.1461-0248.2002.00329.x).
Fussmann food web model includes one to three primary producers, one or two consumers, and primary, secondary, and tertiary predators.
The fussmann_ml code computes the systemâ€™s dynamic behavior (species extinction, steady state, periodic oscillations, or
chaos) for all user-defined parameter combinations.
